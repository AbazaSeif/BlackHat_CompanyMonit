<h3><a name="ABSOTC"> A Basic Test Case </a> </h3>
<p>In this section, I have included a test case for the

<li><b>MultiThreaded.java</b> program.

<li>In this program, if you double click on the <b>CompileRun_MultiThreaded.bat</b> file (a batch file that when will compile and execute the MultiThreaded program), the program will be compiled and executed,
and three threads will be created.
The following messages are displayed:
